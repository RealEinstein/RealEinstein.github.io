<h1>I AM TRYING OUT A DEMO ON THIS NEW TEXT EDITOR</h1>
<p>Who is the king of the demonstration.</p>
<label for="name">Name (at least 4 characters):</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" required minilength="4" maxlength= size="10" >
<Br><label for="name">Age</label>
<input type="color" id="name" name="color" required minilength="1" maxlength="3" size="5" >

<p id="other">It is not easy in this world .Artist use lies to illustrate problems in thier environment,Politicians use the truth,law and order to create problems, and scientist use facts to solve problems. 
Every person is a genius,but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.It will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.A very famous quote by Albert Einstein,German theoretical physicist;won Nobel prize for work on photoelecticity.In whiich he said that each photon of light consists of packets of particles and has energy given by E=mC^2 where E represents the enrgy of light photons ,m represents the mass of  the photons and C is the speed of light which is a constant and has a value of three times ten raised to the power or exponent eight meters per second </p>

This is just a demonstration for us to see whether it really works for us to temper with the structure of the html of high forms.
But it is very okay for us to change some few things with the structure of the html page.It really if very cool to do some little editing 
to it.Sarki is playing music and changing tunes to his music creation.He is now playing old school music.He seems to be really affected by
my uncle Amarus Powers because he now really listens to cools.I bet it affected uncle Aziz too and many other people.Jah rule is the governor of old tafo 
and old tafo is the capital of kumasi.Really! But tafo is now not even part of kuamsi.It has been designated as a distinct part of Ashanti region that's why it is now called old tafo municipal assembly.</p>

<h1 id="heading"><span id="change">THE REAL SECRET BEHIND</span> QUANTUM PHYSICS</h1>
<p id="change-heading">There are four forces in nature.And for each force there is a dedicaated theory to explain that force and there are particles which make those interactions posiible or in other words make us feel the forces we experience,
The forces are;gravitational force ,electrolmagnetic force,weak force and strong force.To each of these forces their corresponding theories are as follows:general theory of relativivity,quantum electrodaynamics,
electroweak theory or flavor daynamic theory or Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory and the last which emerged among the force theories the quantum chromodynamics.<Br>
Let us come to even more astounding facts about this topic.</p>
